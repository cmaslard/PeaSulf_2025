            Sulfur availability in soils affects both yield and seed quality in major crops, and the plant capacity to tolerate environmental constraints. Under stress combination, plants often show specific responses at the molecular level. To dissect the molecular responses to sulfur deficiency in interaction or not with water deficit, a multi-omics approach was used focusing on the leaves of pea (
            Pisum sativum
            ), at several days during the early reproductive phase. Using ionomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and gene network analyses, we identified a module of genes strongly driven by sulfur availability. This includes known and putative new players of plant responses to sulfur-deprived conditions. Conserved profiles between proteins and {mRNAs} were specifically observed within this module, suggesting transcriptional regulation. While moderate water deficit had little impact when occurring alone, it thoroughly perturbed plant growth and the leaf transcriptome and proteome when combined with sulfur deficiency. Under this stress combination, molecular responses were amplified, notably at the transcriptome level, in a time-specific manner. Genes with specific or greater responses under this condition were identified, and transcriptional regulators of the highlighted genes and pathways were predicted, which may represent interesting targets to develop crops tolerant to multi-stress conditions.},

            Improving and stabilizing the quality of seed proteins are of growing interest in the current food and agroecological transitions. Sulfur is a key determinant of this quality since it is essential for the synthesis of sulfur-rich proteins in seeds. A lack of sulfur provokes drastic changes in seed protein composition, negatively impacting the nutritional and functional properties of proteins, and leading in some cases to diseases or health problems in humans. Sulfur also plays a crucial role in stress tolerance through the synthesis of antioxidant or protective molecules. In the context of climate change, questions arise regarding the trade-off between seed yield and seed quality with respect to sulfur availability and use by crops that represent important sources of proteins for human nutrition. Here, we review recent work obtained in legumes, cereals, as well as in Arabidopsis, that present major advances on: (i) the interaction between sulfur nutrition and environmental or nutritional stresses with regard to seed yield and protein composition; (ii) metabolic pathways that merit to be targeted to mitigate negative impacts of environmental stresses on seed protein quality; and (iii) the importance of sulfur homeostasis for the regulation of seed protein composition and its interplay with seed redox homeostasis.},

	abstract = {Pea is a legume crop producing protein-rich seeds and is increasingly in demand for human consumption and animal feed. The aim of this study was to explore the proteome of developing pea seeds at three key stages covering embryogenesis, the transition to seed-filling, and the beginning of storage-protein synthesis, and to investigate how the proteome was influenced by S deficiency and water stress, applied either separately or combined. Of the 3184 proteins quantified by shotgun proteomics, 2473 accumulated at particular stages, thus providing insights into the proteome dynamics at these stages. Differential analyses in response to the stresses and inference of a protein network using the whole proteomics dataset identified a cluster of antioxidant proteins (including a glutathione S-transferase, a methionine sulfoxide reductase, and a thioredoxin) possibly involved in maintaining redox homeostasis during early seed development and preventing cellular damage under stress conditions. Integration of the proteomics data with previously obtained transcriptomics data at the transition to seed-filling revealed the transcriptional events associated with the accumulation of the stress-regulated antioxidant proteins. This transcriptional defense response involves genes of sulfate homeostasis and assimilation, thus providing candidates for targeted studies aimed at dissecting the signaling cascade linking S metabolism to antioxidant processes in developing seeds.},

	abstract = {Water stress and sulfur (S) deficiency are two constraints increasingly faced by crops due to climate change and low-input agricultural practices. To investigate their interaction in the grain legume pea (Pisum sativum), sulfate was depleted at the mid-vegetative stage and a moderate 9-d water stress period was imposed during the early reproductive phase. The combination of the stresses impeded reproductive processes in a synergistic manner, reducing seed weight and seed number, and inducing seed abortion, which highlighted the paramount importance of sulfur for maintaining seed yield components under water stress. On the other hand, the moderate water stress mitigated the negative effect of sulfur deficiency on the accumulation of S-rich globulins (11S) in seeds, probably due to a lower seed sink strength for nitrogen, enabling a readjustment of the ratio of S-poor (7S) to 11S globulins. Transcriptome analysis of developing seeds at the end of the combined stress period indicated that similar biological processes were regulated in response to sulfur deficiency and to the combined stress, but that the extent of the transcriptional regulation was greater under sulfur deficiency. Seeds from plants subjected to the combined stresses showed a specific up-regulation of a set of transcription factor and {SUMO} ligase genes, indicating the establishment of unique regulatory processes when sulfur deficiency is combined with water stress.},

              Pea is a grain legume crop with a high potential to accelerate the food transition due to its high seed protein content and relatively well‚Äêbalanced amino acid composition. The critical role of external sulfur (S) supply in determining seed yield and seed quality in pea makes it essential to understand the impact of whole plant S management on the trade‚Äêoff between these two traits. Here, we investigated the physiological relevance of vacuolar sulfate remobilization by targeting {PsSULTR}4, the only pea sulfate transporter showing substantial similarity to the vacuolar sulfate exporter {AtSULTR}4;1. Five mutations in
              {PsSULTR}4
              were identified by {TILLING} (Targeting Induced Local Lesions {IN} Genomes), two of which, a loss of function (W78*) and a missense (E568K), significantly decreased seed yield under S deprivation. We demonstrate that {PsSULTR}4 triggers S distribution from source tissues, especially lower leaves, to reproductive organs to maintain seed yield under S deficiency. Under sufficient S supply,
              sultr4
              seeds display lower levels of the S‚Äêrich storage protein {PA}1 at maturity. They also overaccumulate sulfate in the endosperm at the onset of seed filling. These findings uncover a role of {PsSULTR}4 in the remobilization of vacuolar sulfate during embryo development, allowing the efficient synthesis of S‚Äêrich proteins. Our study uncovers that {PsSULTR}4 functions (i) in source tissues to remobilize stored vacuolar sulfate for seed production under low S availability and (ii) in developing seeds well supplied with S to fine‚Äêtune sulfate remobilization from the endosperm as a critical control point for storage activities in the embryo.

            Significance Statement
            This study identifies {PsSULTR}4 as the vacuolar sulfate transporter in pea and highlights the role of {PsSULTR}4 and its {STAS} domain in controlling cellular S levels and S partitioning between plant organs. Vacuolar sulfate remobilization mediated by the {PsSULTR}4 transporter enabled the maintenance of seed yield during S deficiency and is vital for the efficient synthesis of S‚Äêrich storage proteins in pea seeds under S sufficiency.},
